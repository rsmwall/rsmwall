## Hello, folks! I'm Rafael! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm a Brazilian student, learning about the wonders of the amazing world of programming. I love open-source software and how they help a lot of people in any area, including the Linux Project.
